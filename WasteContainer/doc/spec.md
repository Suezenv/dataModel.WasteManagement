version: 0.3.0  

## List of properties  

- `RFID`: Gives the ID of the RFID reader.  - `actuationHours`: Hours suitable for performing actuations over the container.  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `annotations`: Annotations about the item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `binCapacity`: Total capacity in terms of the volume of waste the bin can hold.  - `binColor`: Color of the bin. Could be used for indicating the type of waste. The color coding should follow the conventions applicable to the geographical area the bins are located.  - `binFullnessThreshold`: The fullness threshold level of the bin defined as the level (in terms of percentage) when the bin full alert or notification will be generated.  - `binId`: Id of the waste carrying bin  - `binLoggedTime`: Time when the bin's level was last logged.  - `binMaxLoad`: Maximum load (weight) that the waste bin can hold.  - `binRecommendedLoad`: Recommended load (weight) that the waste bin corresponding to this observation can hold.  - `cargoWeight`: Weight of the container load.  - `category`: Enum:' fixed, ground, other, portable, underground'  - `color`: The color of the product  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateLastCleaning`: When the container was cleaned last time.   - `dateLastEmptying`: Timestamp which represents when the container was emptied last time.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateServiceStarted`: Date at which the container started giving service.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `fillingLevel`: Filling level of the container  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `image`: An image of the item  - `isleId`: Identifier (or name) of the isle where the container is placed. This attribute should be used when entities of type `WasteContainerIsle` are not being modelled specifically. Otherwise, `refWasteContainerIsle` should be used.  - `license_plate`: Gives the License Plate number of the vehicle. SameAs: 'license_plate' field from GTFS Realtime message-VehicleDescriptor (https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/reference#message-vehicledescriptor)  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `methaneConcentration`: Methane (CH4) concentration inside the container.  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `nextActuationDeadline`: Deadline for next actuation to be performed (emptying, picking up, etc.).  - `nextCleaningDeadline`: Deadline for next cleaning.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `refDevice`: Reference to the device(s) used to monitor this container  - `refWasteContainerIsle`: Isle where the container is placed  - `refWasteContainerModel`: Container's model  - `regulation`: Regulation under which the container is operating  - `responsible`: Responsible for the container, i.e. entity in charge of  actuating (emptying, collecting, etc)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `serialNumber`: Serial number of the container.  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `status`: Container's status from the point of view of safety. Enum:'ok , lidOpen , dropped , moved , vandalized , burning , unknown'.  -   `ok`. Container is where it must be and stands properly. `lidOpen`. Container's lid has been opened and not closed after a certain amount of time. `dropped`. Container has been dropped for some reason. `moved`. Container has been moved from its regular position and has not come back. `vandalized`. Container has been damaged or destroyed due to vandalism. `burning`. Container is burning and an immediate action has to be taken. `unknown`. The status of the container is not known to the system.  - `storedWasteCode`: Depend on the target regulation. For Europe, check [Europe's List of Waste](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/framework/list.htm).  - `storedWasteKind`: Kind/s of waste stored by the container. Enum:'organic, inorganic, glass, oil, plastic, metal, paper, batteries, electronics, hazardous, other'. Or any other value which does not fit within the former.   - `storedWasteOrigin`: Origin of the waste stored. Enum:'household, municipal, industrial, construction, hostelry, agriculture, other'   - `temperature`: Temperature inside the container  - `timeInstant`: Timestamp of the payload . There can be production environments where the attribute type is equal to the `ISO8601` string. If so, it must be considered as a synonym of `DateTime`. This attribute is kept for backwards compatibility with old FIWARE reference implementations.  - `type`: NGSI Entity Type: It has to be WasteContainer  - `wardId`: Ward Id of the entity corresponding to this observation.
